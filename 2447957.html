        <p>Week 1
            <p>
                <b>Choosing the Right Unity Version:</b>
                <br>Unity is my engine of choice because of its versatility.But picking the right version is 
                <br>important as I have to adjust it as per my teammates.I installed it via the Unity Hub, 
                <br>which makes managing different projects and versions easier.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Defining Visual Style:</b>
                It’s crucial to establish the game’s visual style early on. Is it realistic, cartoonish, or pixelated? The
                visual style should align with the game’s tone and target audience. As a designer, 
                I’ll help define the look and feel of the game world and how assets should fit together within that context. 
            </p>
         <p>
             <b>For a platformer:</b>
             I might focus on how the character's animation feels fluid and how the environment is designed with clear cues.
            For an RPG: I might focus on creating distinct and visually varied characters, creatures, and loot assets.

                
            </p>
        <p>
            <b> Characters and NPCs:</b> 
            The player character and NPCs should not only look distinct but also reflect their role in the game 
            (e.g., a hero’s design might be bold and dynamic, while a villager might be simpler).
            Enemies: Enemies are designed with gameplay mechanics in mind. For example, a flying enemy in a platformer 
            might need to have simple looping animations for its flight patterns.

                
            </p>
        

        <p>Week 2
            <p>
                <b>Planned to make the level 01:</b>
                Discussed about the level 01. About the arenas we are going to make. Reasearch some concepts of the closed arena battle.
                Discussed about the difficulties and the obstracles we can put into the level 01.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Started making the level 01:</b>
                As per the research and the reference for arena we have desided to make the level 01, as an gladiator arena.
                With a close area where there will be ramps for doing the stunts and there will be some obstracles. 
            </p>
        

         <p>Week 3
            <p>
                <b>Level Design for the level 01:</b>
                Started the level design for the !st level which is based on the gladiator arena.
                Used Unreal engine and then going to export it into fbx file for the unity.
                Making the base, like the place for the car fight, 
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Started making the assets of level 01:</b>
                Making the assets such as the stadium, pillars and lights.
            </p>
       
        
        <p>Week 4
            <p>
                <b>Blocking Out the Level:</b>
                Making the blueprint of level to outline major structures.
                Define pathways, platforms, and essential elements without focusing on details.
            </p>

        <p>Week 5
            <p>
                <b>Asset Selection:</b>
                Choose appropriate assets that fit the theme and style of your level.
                Optimize assets to maintain performance while ensuring visual fidelity.
            </p>

        <p>
                <b>Placing Assets:</b>
                Use modular assets to build the environment efficiently.
                Snap assets to the grid for precise alignment, but allow slight variations for a natural look.
            </p>

         <p>Week 6
            <p>
                <b>Lighting & Mood Setting:</b>
                This week I focused on the getting the lighting right for the level 01. Since the level is set
                in a gladiator style arena, I wanted to create that intense, spotlight driven atmosphere. I played around with
                directional lights to stimulate those big stadium, then added point and spotlights in specific areas
                like the ramps, to reeally bring the scene to life. I also tested out of warm tones to help guide 
                player focus and set the mood.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Camera Setup:</b>
                I started working on a dynamic camera system tailored for car battles. It needed to feel
                smooth during normal driving but also adapt during high speed stunt and tight combat.
                I experimented with a few different follow behaviours and camera angle to find a balance 
                that felt cinamatic without making the player lose control or get disoriented.
            </p>
    
        
    <p>
        <b>looking forward:</b>
        <br>To build the assets of the level 01.
        <br>Build the obstracles and design the cars for the level 01.
