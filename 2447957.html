        <p>Week 1
            <p>
                <b>Choosing the Right Unity Version:</b>
                <br>Unity is my engine of choice because of its versatility.But picking the right version is 
                <br>important as I have to adjust it as per my teammates.I installed it via the Unity Hub, 
                <br>which makes managing different projects and versions easier.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Defining Visual Style:</b>
                It’s crucial to establish the game’s visual style early on. Is it realistic, cartoonish, or pixelated? The
                visual style should align with the game’s tone and target audience. As a designer, 
                I’ll help define the look and feel of the game world and how assets should fit together within that context. 
            </p>
         <p>
             <b>For a platformer:</b>
             I might focus on how the character's animation feels fluid and how the environment is designed with clear cues.
            For an RPG: I might focus on creating distinct and visually varied characters, creatures, and loot assets.

                
            </p>
        <p>
            <b> Characters and NPCs:</b> 
            The player character and NPCs should not only look distinct but also reflect their role in the game 
            (e.g., a hero’s design might be bold and dynamic, while a villager might be simpler).
            Enemies: Enemies are designed with gameplay mechanics in mind. For example, a flying enemy in a platformer 
            might need to have simple looping animations for its flight patterns.

                
            </p>
        

        <p>Week 2
            <p>
                <b>Planned to make the level 01:</b>
                Discussed about the level 01. About the arenas we are going to make. Reasearch some concepts of the closed arena battle.
                Discussed about the difficulties and the obstracles we can put into the level 01.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Started making the level 01:</b>
                As per the research and the reference for arena we have desided to make the level 01, as an gladiator arena.
                With a close area where there will be ramps for doing the stunts and there will be some obstracles. 
            </p>
        

         <p>Week 3
            <p>
                <b>Level Design for the level 01:</b>
                Started the level design for the !st level which is based on the gladiator arena.
                Used Unreal engine and then going to export it into fbx file for the unity.
                Making the base, like the place for the car fight, 
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Started making the assets of level 01:</b>
                Making the assets such as the stadium, pillars and lights.
            </p>
       
        
        <p>Week 4
            <p>
                <b>Blocking Out the Level:</b>
                Making the blueprint of level to outline major structures.
                Define pathways, platforms, and essential elements without focusing on details.
            </p>

        <p>Week 5
            <p>
                <b>Asset Selection</b>
                Choose appropriate assets that fit the theme and style of your level.
                Optimize assets to maintain performance while ensuring visual fidelity.
            </p>

        <p>
                <b>Placing Assets</b>
                Use modular assets to build the environment efficiently.
                Snap assets to the grid for precise alignment, but allow slight variations for a natural look.
            </p>
           
    
        
    <p>
        <b>looking forward:</b>
        <br>After defining visual style and progression of the game
        <br>I'll start implementing my ideas in Unity and Unreal engine.
