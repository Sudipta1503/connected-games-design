        <h4>Development Journal</h4>

        <p><b>Week 1 - Setup & Visual Style:</b><br>
        Installed Unity via Unity Hub and configured the project. Defined the visual style — realistic and gritty — fitting our game's tone. Planned distinct looks for characters and enemies.</p>

        <p><b>Week 2 - Level 01 Planning:</b><br>
        Planned Level 01 as a gladiator-style arena. Researched arena concepts and started layout design with ramps and obstacles.</p>

        <p><b>Week 3 - Level Design & Asset Creation:</b><br>
        Created Level 01 base using Unreal, to be exported to Unity. Began modeling assets like the stadium, pillars, and lighting rigs.</p>

        <p><b>Week 4 - Blockout:</b><br>
        Created the basic level structure using placeholder geometry to visualize scale and movement pathways.</p>

        <p><b>Week 5 - Asset Placement:</b><br>
        Selected and positioned environment assets, ensuring alignment and thematic consistency.</p>

        <p><b>Week 6 - Lighting Setup:</b><br>
        Created a spotlight-focused mood using warm tones and directional lights to enhance visibility and tone.</p>

        <p><b>Week 7 - Sound Design:</b><br>
        Planned immersive soundscape including crowd noise, clashing metal, and spatial effects for engine sounds.</p>

        <p><b>Week 8 - Gameplay Testing:</b><br>
        Conducted basic movement and combat tests. Adjusted ramps and sightlines based on player flow analysis.</p>

        <p><b>Week 9 - Visual Polish:</b><br>
        Refined materials, added dirt/wear effects, and used decals to add realism and depth to the arena.</p>

        <p><b>Week 10 - UI/UX:</b><br>
        Sketched HUD design focused on clarity: health, ammo/boost bars, possibly a minimap for larger levels.</p>

        <p><b>Week 11 - Internal Playtest:</b><br>
        Feedback showed cramped areas. Reworked arena layout for better car combat spacing and obstacle flow.</p>

        <p><b>Week 12 - Difficulty Progression:</b><br>
        Designed level changes including enemy spawn pacing and arena hazards to increase challenge over time.</p>

        <p><b>Week 13 - Final Polish:</b><br>
        Refined visuals, adjusted lighting/fog for clarity, and conducted design retrospective to evaluate project goals.</p>
