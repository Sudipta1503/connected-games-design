                <b>Choosing the Right Unity Version:</b>
                <br>Unity is my engine of choice because of its versatility.But picking the right version is 
                <br>important as I have to adjust it as per my teammates.I installed it via the Unity Hub, 
                <br>which makes managing different projects and versions easier.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Defining Visual Style:</b>
                It’s crucial to establish the game’s visual style early on. Is it realistic, cartoonish, or pixelated? The
                visual style should align with the game’s tone and target audience. As a designer, 
                I’ll help define the look and feel of the game world and how assets should fit together within that context. 
            </p>
         <p>
             <b>For a platformer:</b>
             I might focus on how the character's animation feels fluid and how the environment is designed with clear cues.
            For an RPG: I might focus on creating distinct and visually varied characters, creatures, and loot assets.

                
            </p>
        <p>
            <b> Characters and NPCs:</b> 
            The player character and NPCs should not only look distinct but also reflect their role in the game 
            (e.g., a hero’s design might be bold and dynamic, while a villager might be simpler).
            Enemies: Enemies are designed with gameplay mechanics in mind. For example, a flying enemy in a platformer 
            might need to have simple looping animations for its flight patterns.

                
            </p>
        
    <p>
        <b>looking forward:</b>
        <br>After defining visual style and progression of the game
        <br>I'll start implementing my ideas in Unity.
